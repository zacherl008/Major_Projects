A smart object-oriented searcher/sorter in Java. First, the user is prompted for the length of the array that is to be searched and sorted. The user then enters an item and the program uses a try/catch to determine the data type (int, string, char, etc.) in order to support mixed data type arrays. Also supports the ability to hard-code an array. The array is tested for sortability using Comparable casting, and if the array is not sortable the user is informed of this. If the array is found to be comparable, a selection sort is used (bubble sort is also supported) to sort the array which is then returned to the user. The user is then asked to input a search target, and a binary search (jump search is also supported) is run if the array is comparable and otherwise a linear search is run. If the target is found, the index where it is located is returned, otherwise -1 is returned and the user is informed that it has not been located.
