A custom built User Account data structure comprised primarily of a HashMap and ArrayLists. A custom UserAccount class contains an ArrayList of each user's username, password, email, ZIP code, credit card number, and birth date. This class contains the ability to set and retrieve each of these variables with the proper permission. These user accounts are then stored within a HashMap, which contains functions such as addAccount (with regular expressions to ensure the proper data types are entered by the user) to put the user's information into the HashMap. The accessAccount and removeAccount functions allow the user to retrieve and edit their credit card, email, ZIP code, or birthdate (implemented with an interface) or completely delete their account, respectively, if the correct username and password is entered. ofAgeXX functions exist to  check whether the user is of X age using a Calendar object and the date of birth that the user provided.
