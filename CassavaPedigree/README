A major, three month long genetics project undertaken with Sol Genomics Network (SGN) at Boyce Thompson Institute at Cornell University. The topic of this project was to test the genotypes (specifically SNPs) of crop parentages uploaded into the public cassava breeding database CassavaBase to verify the parentage. This is a useful tool for breeders since cassava breeding is generally done using polycrosses where multiple father plants are possible.

This was done through both an R script and a Perl script for sorting, filtering, and analyzing the data. The Perl script utilized various in-house genetics packages in order to connect to the database and test all of the accessions with pedigree records that it contained, while the R script was focused on filtering the SNPs to leave only the most reliable and informative and plotting the data. A test was also created in order to add this script to both the existing SGN code reposity and as a publicly available tool on CassavaBase, which involved designing a JavaScript page using JQuery. This project also involved data visualization, including histograms, scatter plots, and PCAs created in R and pedigrees created in Helium (Data Visualization folder).
