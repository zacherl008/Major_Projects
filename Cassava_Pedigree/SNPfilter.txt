SNP data phased and imputed and converted to dosage format (0 = homozygous reference, 1 = heterozygous, 2 = homozygous non-reference alleles), an additional criteria was used for imputation accuracy:
Filter4: maf1%  and Allelic correlation (7415 SNPs)
SNPs with scores of low confidence can either be marked as NA or populated through a process known as imputing. Imputing utilizes data from the entire cassava population to calculate a score probability and make an educated guess as to what the missing score may be. SNPs with imputed scores are the most inaccurate and SNPs with scores of 1 are also quite uninformative—having one allele for a SNP does not provide information about inheritance patterns like a score of 0 (inherited from neither parent)  or 2 (inherited from both parents) would. Filtering of SNPs is essential in order to obtain the most complete and informative set of information possible. The final filter chosen, with a minor allele frequency of  10%, provided 5621 SNPs.
